  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <ul>
    
    <li id="bio">Bio</li>
      <p>I was born in Billings, MT - which was an hour from where my family lived in Red Lodge. I was raised in Hamilton where I left for the military at 18. I was first stationed in Korea where I got to choose my base of preference when that tour was over. I choose to go to Joint Base Lewis McChord outside of Tacoma. I always felt something special about the PWN when my family would road trip to the coast. After getting out of the Air Force in 2014, I moved up to Seattle - where I've been at home ever since. </p>
    
    <li id="edu">Education</li>
      <p>I attended community college at North Seattle College for a couple years to do general education stuff. I learned I really hate normal learning, and just stopped going before transferring to a 4 year.</p>

    <li id="exp">Experience</li>
      <p> In the Air Force I was a munitions troop, where I just built bombs and missiles. I ended up getting hurt and got stuck to a desk job as a munitions controller, where I just told people what to do on the radio. I got so bored I got a part time job at a bike shop in Tacoma, and stayed with that shop when I got out of the AF. I transferred to the Seattle store while I was going to school, after dropping out of school I ended up working my way up to store manager, where I soon realized I hate that type of work. After a year as manager, I left to join REI as a mechanic where I've been happily employed since.  </p>

    <li id="goals">Goals</li>
        <p>I'd like to start my own business, sell it, start a new one, and repeat that until I can afford to just play bikes all day and help people.</p>
