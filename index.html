  <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div id="bio">
      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>I was born in Billings, MT - which was an hour from where my family lived in Red Lodge. I was raised in Hamilton where I left for the military at 18. I was first stationed in Korea where I got to choose my base of preference when that tour was over. I choose to go to Joint Base Lewis McChord outside of Tacoma. I always felt something special about the PWN when my family would road trip to the coast. After getting out of the Air Force in 2014, I moved up to Seattle - where I've been at home ever since. </p>
